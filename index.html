            Hey there, I am <strong>Archit Mishra</strong>.

        <p>
            I am currently a third year undergraduate in Computer Science at UC San Diego.
            I am interested in distributed systems and infrastructure. Most notably, I have
            worked on Facebook's RocksDB and MyRocks.
